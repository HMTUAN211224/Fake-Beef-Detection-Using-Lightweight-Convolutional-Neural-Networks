# Fake-Beef-Detection-Using-Lightweight-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This repository contains the implementation of a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting fake beef. The model is optimized for efficiency while maintaining high accuracy in distinguishing real beef from substitutes like pork and buffalo meat.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses **MobileNetV2** for lightweight and efficient classification.
- Preprocessing with **HSV color space** and edge detection.
- Trained on a dataset containing real and fake beef images.
- Achieves **>90% accuracy** on the test set.
- Real-time detection capability.
